Twitch HUD for Elite Dangerous Market Connector Overlay

I was trying to build a plugin that retrieved chat messages from Twitch bot and displayed them in the Elite Dangerous Market Connector Overlay.

So far I can get the bot to connect to the chat but it stops EDMC from loading up its main window.

The plugin has to run from the load.py My test bot is Run.py. I know the chat bot will connect to the twitch and print the chat messages to the log. 

To install copy the files into AppData\Local\EDMarketConnector\plugins\TwitchHUD\
