Twitch HUD for Elite Dangerous Market Connector Overlay

I was trying to build a plugin that retrieved chat messages from Twitch bot and displayed them in the Elite Dangerous Market Connector Overlay.

So far I can get the bot to connect to the chat but it stops EDMC from loading up its main window.

The refrences I have been looking at are:
